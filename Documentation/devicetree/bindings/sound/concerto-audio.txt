Google Concerto audio card
==========================

This document describes device-tree bindings for audio on boards based on
the Concerto module.

Required properties:
--------------------
 - compatible: Must include "google,concerto-audio".
 - model: Must be the board model name, e.g. "Google Kennet".
 - clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
   See ../clock/clock-bindings.txt for details.
 - clock-names: Must include "audio_pll" and "mclk".
 - img,cr-periph: Must contain a phandle to the Pistachio peripheral control
   syscon node.
 - img,cr-top: Must contain a phandle to the Pistachio top control syscon node.

Optional properties:
--------------------
 - routing: A list of the connections between audio components.  Each entry
   is a pair of strings, the first being the connection's sink, the second
   being the connection's source.
 - widgets: A list of off-codec widgets.  Each entry is a pair of strings,
   the first being the template name, the second being the card's widget
   name.  Recognized template names are "Microphone", "Line", "Headphone",
   and "Speaker".

Each interface (I2S in/out, S/PDIF in/out, parallel out) has it's own sub-node.
Any combination of these sub-nodes may be specified.

I2S out:
--------
The I2S out sub-node must be named "i2s-out".  A single "cpu" sub-node
is required, and a variable number of codec sub-nodes, which must be named
"codec-{0,1,2,...}", may be specified.

I2S in:
-------
The I2S in sub-node must be named "i2s-in".  A single "cpu" sub-node
is required, and a variable number of codec sub-nodes, which must be named
"codec-{0,1,2,...}", may be specified.

I2S CPU/codec sub-node required properties:
-------------------------------------------
- sound-dai: Must contain a phandle to the CPU DAI or a codec DAI.
- format: Must be set to the DAI's format.

I2S CPU/codec sub-node optional properties:
-------------------------------------------
- name: Optional name for the codec.  This will be used as the name prefix
  for the codec.
- continuous-clock: Indicates the BCLK/LRCLK are always active.
- bitclock-inversion: Indicates the BCLK should be inverted.
- frame-inversion: Indicates the LRCLK should be inverted.
- bitclock-master: Indicates the DAI is the LRCLK master.
- frame-master: Indicates the DAI is the LRCLK master.
- img,i2s-clock-loopback: Indicates that the I2S out BCLK/LRCLK should be
  looped-back internally to the I2S in DAI.  Only applicable to the I2S in
  CPU node.  Note that the I2S out block must be configured as the clock
  master.

S/PDIF out:
-----------
The S/PDIF out sub-node must be named "spdif-out".  A single "cpu" sub-node
is required.

S/PDIF in:
----------
The S/PDIF in sub-node must be named "spdif-in".  A single "cpu" sub-node
is required.

S/PDIF CPU sub-node required properties:
----------------------------------------
- sound-dai: Must contain a phandle to the CPU DAI.

Parallel out:
-------------
The parallel out sub-node must be named "parallel-out".  A single "cpu" sub-node
is required.

Parallel out CPU sub-node required properties:
----------------------------------------------
- sound-dai: Must contain a phandle to the CPU DAI.

Example:
--------
	sound {
		compatible = "google,concerto-audio";
		model = "Google Kennet";
		clocks = <&clk_core CLK_AUDIO_PLL>, <&clk_core CLK_I2S>;
		clock-names = "audio_pll", "mclk";

		img,cr-periph = <&cr_periph>;
		img,cr-top = <&cr_top>;

		i2s-out {
			cpu {
				sound-dai = <&i2s_out>;
				format = "i2s";
				bitclock-master;
				frame-master;
			};
		};

		i2s-in {
			cpu {
				sound-dai = <&i2s_in>;
				format = "i2s";
				img,i2s-clock-loopback;
			};
		};

		parallel-out {
			cpu {
				sound-dai = <&parallel_out>;
			};
		};
	};
